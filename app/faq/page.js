                        <p>
                            Challenge is to design a tool that connects the agricultural community with NASAâ€™s satellite and geospatial datasets in ways that increase data access, integration, and address environmental topics of concern to farmers.

                        <p>
                            By integrating NASA datasets and data analyses in your toolâ€™s design, you can create new solutions and prototypes that support farmers by providing improved prediction capacity, risk management, and/or decision-making processes.

                        <p>
                            Farmers will likely want to determine the characteristics of resources for selected spatial and temporal ranges. They will want to understand how the information relates to their specific situation (e.g., locale, size, and type of farm, etc.).
